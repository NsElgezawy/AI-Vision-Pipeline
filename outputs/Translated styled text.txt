Certainly, here's a paraphrased paraphrase in an Arabic poetic style:

**Whispers on the water page**

A lonely boat, like a silent dream touch on the glass water plate, flows into the majestic ancient mountains that hug the colourful edges of the sky. Every ripple that leaves behind is an echo that whispers in shame, or a fugitive danger in the vastness of the cosmic silence. It is not just a floating boat, but a dream that flows gently through a space that time does not perceive, where the emerald trees stand as witnesses to a world woven from the threads of serenity and the lamps of light.

**Explanation of the changes and method:**

1. Title:** "Whispers on the Water's Surface" immediately adds a poetic touch and sets the tone of the text.
2. Vocabulary:**
    * Use words with poetic connotations such as: "vessel, more evocative than "boat", "silent dream", "glassine", "glides, flows gently", "embraces the decorated edges of the sky – more poetic than "pierce the painted sky"), "ripple", "whispers shyly", "fleeting thought, an escaping thought", "vastness of cosmic silence – instead of "vast embrace of nature"), "embodied", "a space timelessly beyond grasp", "witnesses/monuments – instead of "sentinels"), "woven from threads of tranquility and lamps of light – more creative than "spun from tranquility and light".
3. Tone and Mood:** The sense of serenity, contemplation and mystery has been deepened. The mood became more spiritual and dreamy, with the addition of a touch of diagnosis to nature (Echo whispering shyly).
4. Structure and Syntax:**
    * Use sometimes shorter sentences, and separate thoughts to highlight the image.
    * Changing the order of words sometimes (e.g., introducing the adjective over the descriptor or vice versa) to create a poetic rhythm.
    * Dispense with some direct splicing tools and replace them with commas or the conjunctive "F" to create flow and streamline.
    * Starting with the description of the visual, then moving on to the moral and philosophical.
5. **Figurative Language:**
    As a silent dream's touch, "the glass canvas of the water," "threads of tranquility and lamps of light."
    * **Diagnosis:** "Mountains... "Mountains Emrace", "An Echo Whispers Shyly", "A Space Time Cannot Grasp", "Trees... trees as witnesses."
    Hyperbole:** "vastness of cosmic silence" to maximize the size and stillness of nature.

The goal is to take original images and ideas and transform them into a deeper and more complex sensory and emotional experience in poetic Arabic.
